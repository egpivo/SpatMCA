Title: Regularized Spatial Maximum Covariance Analysis
Version: 1.0.1.0
Date: 2018-04-01

BugReports: https://github.com/egpivo/SpatMCA/issues
Description: Provide regularized maximum covariance analysis incorporating smoothness,
  sparseness and orthogonality of couple patterns by using the alternating direction method
  of multipliers algorithm. The method can be applied to either regularly or irregularly
  spaced data,  including 1D, 2D, and 3D (Wang and Huang, 2017).
